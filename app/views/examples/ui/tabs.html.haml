						You can think three hundred times and still have no precise result. If you see
						attractive girl all you need to do is to go and ask her to give you her phone. You don’t
						need to think about HOW it can turn out. All you have to do is to GO and DO IT. It
						should be super-fast and easy. No hesitation. You ask me: “What to do with these
						fearful thoughts preventing me from doing that?” The answer is to ignore them, because
						they can’t disappear immediately.
					%p The same thing is for startups and ideas. If you have an idea right away after it appears in your mind you should go and make a first step to implement it.

						The same thing is for startups and ideas. If you have an idea right away after it appears
						in your mind you should go and make a first step to implement it. If you will think too
						much it will sink in the swamp of never implemented plans and ideas or will just go away
						or will be implemented by someone else.

						I had an idea named Great Work. It was a service aimed to help people find their passion.
						Yes I know it sound crazy and super naïve but I worked on that. I started to work on
						planning, graphics, presentations, pictures, descriptions, articles, investments and so
						on. I worked on everything but not the project itself

							Light Blue - is a next generation admin template based on the latest Metro design. There are few reasons we want to tell you, why we have created it:
							We didn't like the darkness of most of admin templates, so we created this light one. We didn't like the high contrast of most of admin templates, so we created this unobtrusive one.
							We searched for a solution of how to make widgets look like real widgets, so we decided that deep background - is what makes widgets look real.

								Why don't use Lore Ipsum? I think if some one says don't use lore ipsum it's very controversial point. I think the opposite actually. Everyone knows what is lore ipsum - it is
								easy to understand if text is lore ipsum. You'll automatically skip - because you know - it's just non-informative stub. But what if there some text like this one? You start to read it!
								But the goal of this text is different. So a bit of Lore Ipsum is always great practice
